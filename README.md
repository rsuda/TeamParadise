# TeamParadise
 The purpose of this project is to develop a web application for the Homeowners Association (HOA). The website will be used for a small number of users, where they are able to pay bills and look at past payments. Also some users will be able to post announcements. Some features that may be implemented in the future include a bulletin board where users can post items for sale and possibly a mobile version of the web application.

# Milestone 2
This milestone was focused on implementing the payment function of our application. We were able to implement it easily with the help of PayPal. The other thing that we worked on was getting the frontend in a spot where we could work on the backend more effectively.

# Milestone 3
Milestone 3 was focused on creating the user authentication. This was a particular challenging milestone due to wanting to protect user information. Thankfully the PayPal piece allowed us to focus more on information that wasn't as crucial. For this part we needed to connect our frontend to communicate with our backend.

# Milestone 4
Milestone 4 was needed to clean up any bugs or issues before presenting it to our client. Getting it to a working condition and presentable was quite challenging but we were able to overcome it. Another tool we added was allowing admins to add dues and delete posts from other users.
